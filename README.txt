*** NOTICE ***

The way this project is organized and hosted on Github, it's required that the latest version is the one pushed to Github. If you copy it elsewhere that must be done after it's been pushed to Github. 
If this isn't done, it creates two differing locations for the project with possible conflicts, which is what using Github is supposed to prevent.


*** GLA PROCEDURE ***

When creating a new GLA, everyone should copy the GLA Template folder from the W.I.P. folder in the root of the project. That way new versions of the code can be distributed to new GLAs without too much hassle.
Obviously if you're making a change to the template be sure to test it or we could have some problems down the line.
