*** NOTICE ***

The way this project is organized and hosted on Github, it's required that the latest version is the one pushed to Github. If you copy it elsewhere that must be done after it's been pushed to Github. 
If this isn't done, it creates two differing locations for the project with possible conflicts, which is what using Github is supposed to prevent.
