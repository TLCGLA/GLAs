<br>

<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 1: </font>First, you need to open a PowerPoint with a presentation and activities.  
<a href="geometry.ppt">Click here to open the PowerPoint.</a>


<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 2: </font>Once the PowerPoint is open, read through the PowerPoint slides #1-7.  Pay particular
     attention to the definitions and the diagrams and how the example problems are set up.

<a href="geometry_quiz.html"     >completing this quiz.</a>  Use a blank 
				  sheet of paper for your work.  Once you are done, ask a tutor to go over your quiz results and the 
				  self-evaluation with you.
