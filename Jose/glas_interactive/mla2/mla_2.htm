Once you have mastered the basics of MLA citation format (how to create parenthetical citations and a Works Cited page) you 
are ready to learn some  advanced quoting and citing methods.  <br><br>

This activity will help you become a stronger student and a better writer by giving you additional instruction and practice 
in quoting and citing your sources.  By the end of this activity, you will be able to do the following:

<ul>
<li>Use ellipsis to indicate that you are omitting material from a passage you are quoting</li>
<li>Use square brackets to insert your own words into a quote for purposes of clarification</li>
<li>Use the "quoted in" citation to indicate that the comment you are quoting appeared as a quote in the original source</li>
<li>Use signal phrases to present an author's credentials or to preview a passage you are quoting</li>
<li>Smoothly integrate segments of source material into your own sentences</li>
<li>Use block format for lengthy quotations</li>
<li>Use single and double quotation marks for a quote-within-a-quote</li>

</ul>
<br>

                  and handouts in front of you, view this <a href="MLA2 slidesPowerpoint.pptx">PowerPoint presentation</a> on advanced quoting and citing techniques.

				  As you work on the exercises, please have the "Student Handout" next to you for reference; it contains the information you 
				  need to complete the exercises. <br><br>
