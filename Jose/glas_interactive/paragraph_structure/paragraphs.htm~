When writing essays, you often have to cite sources in the body of the essay.  In this guided learning activity, you will 
learn the correct way to incorporate sources in paragraphs. By the end of this activity, you will:

<ul>
<li> Compose a source based paragraph of 8- 11 sentences</li>
<li> Integrate 2-3 direct quotations in a single paragraph</li>
<li> Effectively contextualize and analyze the quotations</li>
</ul>





<font color="#003366" size="+1">Instructions</font><br><br>
<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>

  
<font color="#003366">Step 1: </font>First you'll need make sure you have the handouts for this activity.  
If you don't, ask a tutor to help you.<br><br>


                  <font color="#003366">Step 2: </font>Carefully read the handout, &#8220;What 
is a Body Paragraph&#8221;.  &nbsp;Make notes and highlight questions that you have.<br>
<br>
<font color="#003366">Step 3: </font>Read the &#8220;Quotations for Source-Based Paragraph&#8221; handout. You will use the quotes in this handout to write your own paragraph around a topic sentence that's included
in the handout.  (If you are curious, the topic sentence is "Changing gender roles in the workplace are causing difficult adjustments for American husbands and wives.")
                  
                  <ul>
                  
                  <li>With the topic in mind, think about what main points will support your topic sentence. Identify 2 or 3 main points you would make about it.</li>
                  <li>Once you have the main points, decide which quote you will use to support each main point. Select one quote for each main point.</li>                  
                  </ul>

                  
                  <font color="#003366">Step 4: </font> STOP and review your ideas with a tutor.  As you look at your work with a tutor, ensure that the quotations are good choices to support your main points.
<br>
<br>

<font color="#003366">Step 5: </font> Now, you will use the "8-11 Sentence Map" handout to build a paragraph 
with the main points and quotations you selected.  In the handout, complete each numbered instruction to outline the sentences of your paragraph. Follow the instructions for each sentence on the outline.<br><br>

<font color="#003366">Step 6: </font>STOP and review your outline with a tutor. <br><br>
				  
<font color="#003366">Step 7: </font>Now that you have a detailed outline for your paragraph, it's time to 
put it all together.  What you are going to do now is turn the outline into an actual paragraph.  Put the sentences that you composed on the outline map into paragraph form, keeping them in order and making sure that each flows smoothly into the next.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#003366">Step 8: </font>STOP and review your paragraph with a tutor. <br><br>
<font color="#003366">Step 9: </font>You are now done with the practice part of the guided learning activity.  What's left now is to complete a self-reflection exercise that will ask you to think about what you have learned here.
  Find the "Final Self-Reflection" handout and answer the questions in it.<br><br>
<font color="#003366">Step 10: </font>Discuss your final self-reflection with a tutor before you leave.
