One of the biggest challenges in writing a paper is coming up with ideas.  Your instructor may have given you a 
general topic to work with, but how can you narrow that topic?  Once narrowed, how do you come up with ideas for 
your paper?  Do you even know what you believe or feel about the topic?  To help you overcome these common obstacles, 
this workshop will focus on the prewriting stage of the writing process and give you strategies you can use to generate 
ideas for your writing projects.<br><br>

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Explain the importance of the prewriting stage of the writing process</li>
<li>Describe various prewriting strategies (asking questions, brainstorming, clustering, freewriting, talking it out)</li>
<li>Select and apply prewriting strategies to writing tasks</li>
</ul>

<br>
<font color="#003366" size="+1">In this activity, you will do the following:</font>

<ol>
<li>You will view a brief slide presentation.</li>
<li>You will complete a series of exercises based on the presentation.</li>
<li>You will briefly reflect on what you have learned in this workshop.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<font color="#003366" size="+1">Let's get started!</font><br>

<br>
<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br>

<br>

<font color="#003366" size="+1">Step 1: </font>First you'll need make sure you have the 
handouts this activity.  If you don't, ask a tutor to help you.<br><br>

<font color="#003366" size="+1">Step 2: </font>Once you have the handouts in front of you, view this 
<a href="Prewriting Strategies.pptx">PowerPoint</a> presentation.  Please view the slide presentation now, and then use the 
worksheet to complete the activities.  NOTE:  Some exercises require that you 
work with a partner do a role-play. Please ask a tutor to be your partner for 
those exercises.<br>

<br>
<font color="#003366" size="+1">Step 3: </font>The last step is to complete the self-reflection exercise 
and go over your answers with a tutor</strong><br>
                  <br>
