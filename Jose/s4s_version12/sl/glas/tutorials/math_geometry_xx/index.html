			<p>Believe it or not, geometry was originally developed to measure land for agricultural purposes.  The prefix "geo" means land, and "metry" refers to measurement, 
			so, literally, when you study geometry what you are doing is learning how to measure land.  Now, geometry has advanced beyond it's agricultural uses in ancient Egipt, and 
			has been applied to many other things.  Geometry was used in ancient times to figure out how the position and the movements of planets, to navigate the seas, 
			to study music, to tell time on solar clocks...  In modern times, it has found many, many more applications.  The point is that geometry has a huge number of applications and 
			is a great tool to understand spaces and objects.  When you learn geometry, you are learning how to use a new, wonderful tool to help you understand the world.
