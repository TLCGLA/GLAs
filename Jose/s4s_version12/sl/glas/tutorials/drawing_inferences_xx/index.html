			<p>Most of your courses involve reading texts. Even visual media, such as films, are considered 
                &#34;texts&#34; to be read and understood by the viewer. But not 
                all of the ideas in a text are stated directly. You must often 
                &#34;read between the lines&#34; to interpret what an author is 
                saying. That is, you need to make inferences, and this requires 
                your own participation as much as the author's. To make reasonable 
                inferences, you not only need to carefully observe the details 
                in the text, but you need to contribute your own knowledge and 
                experiences. But how do you know which inferences are &#34;reasonable&#34; 
                and which ones are not? This workshop will help you make reasonable 
                inferences.</p>

			<p>By the end of this activity, you should be able to:</p>
	        <ul>
              <li>Distinguish between &#34;reasonable inferences&#34; plausible) 
                and &#34;unreasonable inferences&#34; (contradictory or unfounded)</li>
              <li>Identify the key components of reading for inferences</li>
              <li>Apply the above skills to various aspects of written and visual 
                texts</li>
