Welcome to the Uniform Motion Word Problems guided learning activity. By the end of this activity, you will be able to set up and solve various kinds of 
uniform motion problems.

<font color="#003366" size="+1"   >Instructions</font><br>
<br>

<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 1: </font>First, you need to open a PowerPoint with a presentation and activities.  
<a href="http://www.tcc.edu/VML/Mth03/lessons.htm"   >Click here</a> to go to the site where the PowerPoint is housed. Click on the word &#8220;Motion&#8221; to 
access the PowerPoint presentation.  



<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 2: </font>Once the PowerPoint is open, read through slides #1-19.  Pay particular
     attention to the formulas, the distance diagrams and how the  
     example problems are set up by using a table.

<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 3: </font>&nbsp;On a separate piece of paper, work 
through the four practice problems given in slides #20-22. Make sure to use a 
table to set up the problems and draw a picture to determine how the distances 
are related. Ask a tutor for help if you get stuck
<br><br>
				  <font color="#003366"   >Step 4: </font>Check your answers on slide #23.  If you did not get all four 
     practice problems correct, go on to slides #24-37 and determine 
     where you went wrong.  Next to each practice problem on your 
     scratch paper, write down in complete sentences what you did
     wrong and what steps you can take so that you will not make the
     same mistake again in the future.<br><br>

<font color="#003366"   >Step 5: </font>Let&#8217;s see how much you have learned by 
<a   href="uniform_motion_quiz.html"   >completing this quiz.</a>  Use a blank 
				  sheet of paper for your work.  Once you are done, ask a tutor to go over your quiz results and the 
				  self-evaluation with you.

about solving uniform motion word problems.</strong>
