			<p>Do you sometimes struggle when you write a paper?   Do you ever have trouble coming up with ideas? 
 Do you get stuck halfway through and want to give up?  If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, 
 then you're in a class with the greatest writers of all time!  Writing is hard work, and no matter how good a 
 writer you are, you will often struggle with "writer's block"&#8212;that feeling of hitting a wall during the writing process.  
 This workshop will give you some strategies for dealing with writer's block.  Since most of your college courses 
 require written work such as essays and term papers, you'll have many opportunities to apply the strategies throughout 
 your academic career&#8212;and beyond</p>
