			<p>Whenever we are looking at a compound, like water, blood, air, or steel, we are looking at a mixture.  As you can see from the examples, 
			even very basic things are actually a combination of more basic elements.  Mixtures are all around us and in us.  Understanding their composition 
			and answering questions dealing with how individual components combine in a mixture is a valuable tool, which not only will give you a practical
			problem-solving method, but provide you with a deeper insight into the nature of things.</p>
