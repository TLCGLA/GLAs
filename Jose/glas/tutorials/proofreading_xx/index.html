			<p>Proofreading is the stage in the writing process in which the writer reviews the essay to check for surface errors 
that were inadvertently included. Because it is frequently the final stage in the writing process, proofreading is 
often omitted. Students may finish writing an essay late at night and may be too tired to review it. 
Students may have procrastinated in completing the essay and barely have enough time to print a copy before class begins. 
As a result, students are not submitting their best work and are not receiving the grades they expect. Sadly, some of the errors 
that frequently appear on a final draft could have been detected and corrected had the student taken the time to proofread. 

This workshop will present several proofreading strategies and alert you to the areas in which frequent errors occur.</p>
