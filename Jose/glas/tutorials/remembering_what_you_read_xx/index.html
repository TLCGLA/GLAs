			<p>Readers often get distracted from their readings--they go into a "reading coma"--and lose track of what they are reading. When 
readers are distracted, they either continue reading without having grasped the content of the reading or, if they realize that they got distracted, 
backtrack in the text to the last part they remember.</p><br>
<p>Although becoming distracted while reading is normal, there are some strategies that readers can use to stay focused on the text.  In this learning 
activity, you will learn how to apply reading strategies to reduce the wasted time, the frustration, and the missed 
information caused by the "reading coma".</p>

                            your effectiveness as a reader and as a student.</li>
                          <li>Recognize when you have fallen into the reading 
                            coma and self-correct by using active reading strategies 
                            to avoid it in the future.</li>
