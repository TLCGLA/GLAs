			<p>The word "fraction" comes from the Latin word "fractus", or broken, so when we think of fractions we think about something broken up into smaller units.  
			Think, for example of English words such as fracture, which also points to breaking things up into smaller units.  This means that when we add fractions we 
			are putting smaller units together to make a larger whole, and when we subtract fractions we are taking smaller units away, to produce something smaller. A 
			good way to visualize adding and subtracting fractions is with pizza slices.  When you take away slices, you are subtracting, and when you put the slices 
			back in, you are adding.  Knowing how to handle this process of breaking things down and put them together is an essential skill that will help you understand 
			many mathematical concepts used in everyday life.</p>
