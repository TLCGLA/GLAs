Welcome to the Solving Rational Equations guided learning activity. By the end of this activity, you will be able to set up and solve 
rational equations.

<br>

<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 1: </font>First, you need to open a PowerPoint with a presentation and activities.  
<a href="rational_equations_gla.pptx">Click here to open the PowerPoint</a>.


<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 2: </font>Once the PowerPoint is open, read and work through 
     slides #1-10.  Pay particular attention to finding the common 
     denominators and eliminating the fractions.


<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 3: </font>On a separate piece of paper, work through the practice 
     problem given in slide #11.  Make sure to check your answer. Ask a tutor to help you if you get stuck.

				  <br><br>
				  <font color="#003366"   >Step 4: </font>Check your answers on slide #12-13.  If you did not get the 
     practice problem correct, determine where you went wrong. 
     Next to each practice problem on your scratch paper, write down 
     in complete sentences what you did wrong and what steps you 
     can take so that you will not make the same mistake again in the
     future.<br><br>

<font color="#003366"   >Step 5: </font>Now read and work through slides #14-17.  Pay particular
     attention to the proportions and cross multiplying correctly.
<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 6: </font>On a separate sheet of paper, work out the practice problem on
     slide #18.  Ask a tutor to help you if you get stuck. <br><br>

<font color="#003366"   >Step 7: </font>Check your answer on slide #19.  If you did not get the 
     practice problem correct, determine where you went wrong. 
     Next to each practice problem on your scratch paper, write down 
     in complete sentences what you did wrong and what steps you 
     can take so that you will not make the same mistake again in the
     future.
<br><br>


 <font color="#003366"   >Step 8: </font>Let&#8217;s see how much you have learned by 
<a href="rational_equations_quiz.html"     >completing this quiz.</a>  Use a blank 
				  sheet of paper for your work.  Once you are done, ask a tutor to go over your quiz results and the 
				  self-evaluation with you.
