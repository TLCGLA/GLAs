<br>
Stress can be good and bad. An example of good stress can be a project or an assignment you are given in class with a reasonable amount of time to finish. 
This can be similar to a goal you can work towards during the semester. View the assignment as something positive to work towards in the same way a student 
would work towards a personal goal. Shifting your perspective is a way that you can turn a potential source of bad stress into an example of good stress. 
Examples of bad stress are easier for students to identify with. This can be the stress of traffic jams, school, juggling part-time jobs...
<br><br>
Knowing how to manage all types of stress is a valuable skill for all students. It is a way to balance your responsibilities in school, work, and personal life. 
Students deal with stress every day and can be overwhelmed by all of the demands they need to juggle. There are effective ways of coping with stress 
that can be practiced and implemented to improve the way you deal with stress. <br><br>
