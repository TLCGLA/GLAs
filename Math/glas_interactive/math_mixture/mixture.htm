<br>

<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 1: </font>First, you need to open a PowerPoint with a presentation and activities.  
<a href="mixture.pptx">Click here to open the PowerPoint.</a>


<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 2: </font>Once the PowerPoint is open, read and work through 
     slides #1-27.  Pay particular attention to the formulas and how
     the example problems are set up by using a table.


<br><br>
<font color="#003366"   >Step 3: </font>On a separate piece of paper, work through the two practice 
     problems given in slide #29.  Make sure to use a table to set 
     up the problems.  Ask a tutor to help you if you get stuck.
.

				  <br><br>
				  <font color="#003366"   >Step 4: </font>Check your answers on 
slide #30. If you did not get both practice problems correct, go on to slides 
#31-34 and determine where you went wrong. <br><br>

<font color="#003366"   >Step 5: </font> You will now do a self-evaluation of your work.  Next to each practice problem on your 
scratch paper, write down in complete sentences what you did wrong and what steps you can take so that you will not make the same mistake again in the 
future.  Ask a tutor to help you if you get stuck.<br><br>


 <font color="#003366"   >Step 6: </font>Let&#8217;s see how much you have learned by 
<a href="mixture_quiz.html"     >completing this quiz.</a>  Use a blank 
				  sheet of paper for your work.  Once you are done, ask a tutor to go over your quiz results and the 
				  self-evaluation with you.
<br><br>
				  
				  <strong>That's it! Thank you for taking the time to learn 
about solving mixture word problems.</strong>
