<strong>If at any time you need help please ask a tutor.</strong><br><br>
<font color="#003366">Step 1: </font>First you'll need make sure you have the 
<a href="GLA_textbook_reading_handouts.doc">handouts</a> for this activity.  
If you don't, ask a tutor to help you.<br>
<br>
<font color="#003366">Step 2: </font>Listen to the lecture on reading strategies and "think aloud" process.  The 
lecture will cover the following points: 
<ol>
<li>Overview of the reading process</li>
<li>Strategies that good readers use</li>
<li>Description of "think aloud" process</li>
</ol>
To listen to the lecture, you will have to put on headsets and then 
<a href="GLA_textbook_reading_lecture.wmv">click here</a> to start the lecture.
<br>
<br>
                  <font color="#003366">Step 3: </font>Locate the worksheet in 
                  one of the handouts you were given. You will now watch a video of 2 readers thinking out loud while reading. (A transcript 
                  [or written copy] of the text is provided for you in one of 
                  the handouts if you want to follow along on the text.) <br><br>
				  Using the student worksheet, take notes on what 
                  she says when she thinks aloud. Then refer to list of strategies 
                  at the top of the worksheet. For each model, identify the numbers 
                  of 3 strategies that the reader used and include them in your 
                  notes in parts 1 and 2 of the handout.<br>
                  <br>

When you are ready to go, <a href="Think aloud model.wmv">click here to watch the video models 1 and 2</a>.

<br><br>
                  <font color="#003366">Step 4: </font> STOP and locate a tutor to review your notes with you for Model #1 and #2. 
				  <br>
                  <br>
				  <font color="#003366">Step 5: </font>Now you get to practice reading aloud with a tutor.  Find the handout called "texts 
				  for practice with a tutor" and use it for this practice. As the tutor listens to you, read the paragraphs and think aloud 
				  as you are reading and making sense of the text, just like you saw in the video models. Recall the list of strategies that 
				  good readers use and try to use them.<br><br>
				  
				  
				  <font color="#003366">Step 6: </font>Complete part 3 on the worksheet which asks you to explain what you discovered about 
				  your reading process and what strategies you plan to use when reading textbooks. Keep your worksheet and submit to your 
				  instructor if required.
				  <br><br>
				  
                  <font color="#003366">Step 7: </font>When you are done with 
                  the activity, find a tutor to review your work with you.<br>
                  <br>

Good luck!
